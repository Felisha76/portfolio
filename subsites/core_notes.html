    <tr><td>	printing	</td><td>	"Let's start off by creating a short program that displays ""Hello world!"".
        In Python, we use the print statement to output text. 
        Note that the text should be enclosed into single or double quotes. 
        The print statement needs to be followed by parentheses, which enclose the output we want to generate.
        The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.
        Each print statement outputs text from a new line.
        Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. 
        This is why the words, ""spam"" and ""eggs"" are often used as placeholder variables in Python."	</td><td>	print('Hello world!')	</td></tr>

        Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.
        Enter a calculation directly into the print statement:
        print(2 + 2)
        print(5 + 4 - 3)
        The spaces around the plus and minus signs here are optional 
        (the code would work without them), but they make it easier to read.
        Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk * to indicate multiplication and a forward slash / to indicate division.
        Use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
        Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). We'll have more about floats in the next lesson."	</td><td>	"print(2 + 2)

        They can be created directly by entering a number with a decimal point, or by using operations such as division on integers.  Computers can't store floats perfectly accurately, in the same way that we can't write down the complete decimal expansion of 1/3 (0.3333333333333333...). Keep this in mind, because it often leads to infuriating bugs!     A float is also produced by running an operation on two floats, or on a float and an integer.  A float can be added to an integer, because Python silently converts the integer to a float."	</td><td>	"print( 3/4 )

        Double quotes only need to be escaped in double quote strings, and the same is true for single quote strings.

        Strings can also be multiplied by integers. This produces a repeated version of the original string. The order of the string and the integer doesn't matter, but the string usually comes first.
        Strings can't be multiplied by other strings. Strings also can't be multiplied by floats, even if the floats are whole numbers."	</td><td>	"print(""Spam"" + 'eggs')

        <tr><td>	Variables	</td><td>	"A variable allows you to store a value by assigning it to a name, which can be used to refer to the value later in the program.
        For example, in game development, you would use a variable to store the points of the player.
        
        To assign a variable, use one equals sign.
        In given example we assigned string ""James"" to user variable.
        
        Certain restrictions apply in regard to the characters that may be used in Python variable names. The only characters that are allowed are letters, numbers, and underscores. Also, they can't start with numbers.
        Not following these rules results in errors.
        
        Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, Lastname and lastname are two different variable names in Python.
        
        You can use variables to perform corresponding operations, just as you did with numbers and strings.
        As you can see, the variable stores its value throughout the program.
        
        Variables can be reassigned as many times as you want, in order to change their value.
        In Python, variables don't have specific types, so you can assign a string to a variable, and later assign an integer to the same variable.
        However, it is not good practice. To avoid mistakes, try to avoid overwriting the same variable with different data types."	</td><td>	"user = ""James""

        <tr><td>	Input	</td><td>	"To get input from the user in Python, you can use the intuitively named input function.
        For example, a game can ask for the user's name and age as input and use them in the game.
        
        The input function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string (with the contents automatically escaped).
        Even if the user enters a number as input, it is processed as a string.
        
        The input statement needs to be followed by parentheses.
        You can provide a string to input() between the parentheses, producing a prompt message.
        
        The prompt message helps to clarify what input the program is asking for.
        
        Let's assume we want to take the age of the user as input.
        We know that the input() function returns a string.
        To convert it to a number, we can use the int() function:
        
        Similarly, in order to convert a number to a string, the str() function is used. This can be useful if you need to use a number in string concatenation.
        
        You can convert to float using the float() function.
        
        You can use input() multiple times to take multiple user inputs.
        When input() function executes, program flow stops until a user enters some value."	</td><td>	"x = input()

        The input function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string (with the contents automatically escaped).
        In-place operators allow you to write code like 'x = x + 3' more concisely, as 'x += 3'.
        The same thing is possible with other operators such as -, *, / and % as well.
        
        These operators can be used on types other than numbers, as well, such as strings.
        In-place operators can be used for any numerical operation (+, -, *, /, %, **, //).
        
        Walrus operator := allows you to assign values to variables within an expression, including variables that do not exist yet.

        <tr><td>	Booleans True False == !== < >	</td><td>	"Another type in Python is the Boolean type. There are two Boolean values: True and False.
        They can be created by comparing values, for instance by using the equal operator ==.
        Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equals sign) with comparison (two equals signs).
        
        Another comparison operator, the not equal operator (!=), evaluates to True if the items being compared aren't equal, and False if they are. Comparison operators are also called Relational operators.
        Python also has operators that determine whether one number (float or integer) is greater than or smaller than another. These operators are > and < respectively.
        Different numeric types can also be compared, for example, integer and float.
        
        The greater than or equal to, and smaller than or equal to operators are >= and <=.
        They are the same as the strict greater than and smaller than operators, except that they return True when comparing equal numbers.
        
        Greater than and smaller than operators can also be used to compare strings lexicographically (the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters).
        The first characters from ""Annie"" and ""Andy"" (A and A) are compared. As they are equal, the second two characters are compared. Because they are also equal, the third two characters (n and d) are compared. And because n has greater alphabetical order value than d, ""Annie"" is greater than ""Andy""."	</td><td>	"my_boolean = True

        <tr><td>	if Statements	</td><td>	"Another type in Python is the Boolean type. There are two Boolean values: True and False.
        You can use if statements to run code if a certain condition holds.
        If an expression evaluates to True, some statements are carried out. Otherwise, they aren't carried out.
        An if statement looks like this:
        if expression:
           statements
        
        Python uses indentation (white space at the beginning of a line) to delimit blocks of code. Depending on program's logic, indentation can be mandatory. As you can see, the statements in the if should be indented.
        The expression determines whether 10 is greater than 5. Since it is, the indented statement runs, and ""10 greater than 5"" is output. Then, the unindented statement, which is not part of the if statement, is run, and ""Program ended"" is displayed.
        Notice the colon at the end of the expression in the if statement.
        
        To perform more complex checks, if statements can be nested, one inside the other.
        This means that the inner if statement is the statement part of the outer one. This is one way to see whether multiple conditions are satisfied.
        
        Indentation is used to define the level of nesting."	</td><td>	"if 10 > 5:
            print(""10 greater than 5"")

        if num > 5:
            print(""Bigger than 5"")
            if num <=47:
                print(""Between 5 and 47"")"	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	else elif	</td><td>	"The if statement allows you to check a condition and run some statements, if the condition is True.
        The else statement can be used to run some statements when the condition of the if statement is False.
        
        As with if statements, the code inside the block should be indented.
        Notice the colon after the else keyword.
        
        Every if condition block can have only one else statement.
        In order to make multiple checks, you can chain if and else statements.
        
        For example, the following program checks and outputs the num variable's value as text:
        num = 3
        if num == 1:
            print(""One"")
        else: 
            if num == 2:
                print(""Two"")
            else: 
                if num == 3: 
                    print(""Three"")
                else: 
                    print(""Something else"")
        
        Indentation determines which if/else statements the code blocks belong to.
        
        Multiple if/else statements make the code long and not very readable.
        The elif (short for else if) statement is a shortcut to use when chaining if and else statements, making the code shorter.
        
        The same example from the previous part can be rewritten using elif statements:
        num = 3
        if num == 1:
            print(""One"")
        elif num == 2:
            print(""Two"")
        elif num == 3: 
            print(""Three"")
        else: 
            print(""Something else"")
        
        As you can see in the example above, a series of if elif statements can have a final else block, which is called if none of the if or elif expressions is True.
        The elif statement is equivalent to an else/if statement. It is used to make the code shorter, more readable, and avoid indentation increase."	</td><td>	"num = 3

        Boolean operators can be used in expression as many times as needed.
        
        The or operator also takes two arguments. It evaluates to True if either (or both) of its arguments are True, and False if both arguments are False.
        Besides values, you can also compare variables.
        
        Unlike other operators we've seen so far, not only takes one argument, and inverts it.

        A list is created using square brackets with commas separating items.
        words = [""Hello"", ""world"", ""!""]
        
        In the example above the words list contains three string items.
        A certain item in the list can be accessed by using its index in square brackets.
        
        For example:
        words = [""Hello"", ""world"", ""!""]
        print(words[0])

        print(words[2]) 
        
        The first list item's index is 0, rather than 1, as might be expected.
        
        Sometimes you need to create an empty list and populate it later during the program. For example, if you are creating a queue management program, the queue is going to be empty in the beginning and get populated with people data later.
        
        An empty list is created with an empty pair of square brackets.
        empty_list = []
        print(empty_list)
        
        In some code samples you might see a comma after the last item in the list. It's not mandatory, but perfectly valid.
        
        Typically, a list will contain items of a single item type, but it is also possible to include several different types.
        Lists can also be nested within other lists.

        Nested lists can be used to represent 2D grids, such as matrices.
        m = [
            [1,2,3],
            [4,5,6]
            ]
            
        print(m[1][2]) 
        
        A matrix-like structure can be used in cases where you need to store data in row-column format. For example, when creating a ticketing program, the seat numbers can be stored in a matrix, with their corresponding rows and numbers.
        The code above outputs the 3rd item of the 2nd row.
        
        Some types, such as strings, can be indexed like lists.
        Indexing strings behaves as though you are indexing a list containing each character in the string.
        
        For example:
        str = ""Hello world!""
        print(str[6])
        
        Space ("" "") is also a symbol and has an index.
        Trying to access a non-existing index will produce an error.

        print(nums)
        You can replace the item with an item of a different type.
        
        Lists can be added and multiplied in the same way as strings.
        nums = [1, 2, 3]
        print(nums + [4, 5, 6])
        print(nums * 3)
        
        Lists and strings are similar in many ways - strings can be thought of as lists of characters that can't be changed.
        For example, the string ""Hello"" can be thought of as a list, where each character is an item in the list. The first item is ""H"", the second item is ""e"", and so on.
        
        To check if an item is in a list, the in operator can be used.
        It returns True if the item occurs one or more times in the list, and False if it doesn't.
        
        words = [""spam"", ""egg"", ""spam"", ""sausage""]
        print(""spam"" in words)
        print(""egg"" in words)
        print(""tomato"" in words)
        
        The in operator is also used to determine whether or not a string is a substring of another string.
        
        To check if an item is not in a list, you can use the not operator in one of the following ways:
        nums = [1, 2, 3]
        print(not 4 in nums)
        print(4 not in nums)

        nums = [1, 2, 3]
        nums.append(4)
        print(nums)
        
        The dot before append is there because it is a method of the list class. Methods will be explained in a later lesson.
        
        To get the number of items in a list, you can use the len function.
        Unlike the index of the items, len does not start with 0. So, the list above contains 5 items, meaning len will return 5.
        
        len is written before the list it is being called on, without a dot.
        nums = [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
        print(len(nums))
        
        The insert method is similar to append, except that it allows you to insert a new item at any position in the list, as opposed to just at the end.
        words = [""Python"", ""fun""]
        index = 1
        words.insert(index, ""is"")
        print(words)
        
        Elements, that are after the inserted item, are shifted to the right.
        
        The index method finds the first occurrence of a list item and returns its index.
        If the item isn't in the list, it raises a ValueError.
        letters = ['p', 'q', 'r', 's', 'p', 'u']
        print(letters.index('r'))
        print(letters.index('p'))
        print(letters.index('z'))
        
        There are a few more useful functions and methods for lists.
        max(list): Returns the list item with the maximum value
        min(list): Returns the list item with minimum value
        list.count(item): Returns a count of how many times an item occurs in a list
        list.remove(item): Removes an object from a list
        list.reverse(): Reverses items in a list.
        
        For example, you can count how many 42s are there in the list using:
        items.count(42)
        where items is the name of our list."	</td><td>	"nums = [1, 2, 3]

        <tr><td>	while Loops	</td><td>	"A while loop is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
        For example, let's say we need to process multiple user inputs, so that each time the user inputs something, the same block of code needs to execute.
        
        Below is a while loop containing a variable that counts up from 1 to 5, at which point the loop terminates.
        
        i = 1
        while i <=5:
            print(i)
            i = i + 1
        
        print(""Finished!"")
        
        During each loop iteration, the i variable will get incremented by one, until it reaches 5.
        So, the loop will execute the print statement 5 times.
        
        The code in the body of a while loop is executed repeatedly. This is called iteration.
        
        You can use multiple statements in the while loop.
        
        For example, you can use an if statement to make decisions. This can be useful, if you are making a game and need to loop through a number of player actions and add or remove points of the player.
        
        The code below uses an if/else statement inside a while loop to separate the even and odd numbers in the range of 1 to 10:
        x = 1
        while x < 10:
            if x%2 == 0:
                print(str(x) + "" is even"")
            else:
                print(str(x) + "" is odd"")
        
            x += 1 
        
        str(x) is used to convert the number x to a string, so that it can be used for concatenation.
        
        In console, you can stop the program's execution by using the Ctrl-C shortcut or by closing the program.
        
        To end a while loop prematurely, the break statement can be used.
        For example, we can break an infinite loop if some condition is met:
        i = 0
        while 1==1:
            print(i)
            i = i + 1
            if i >= 5:
                print(""Breaking"")
                break
        
        print(""Finished"")
        
        while True is a short and easy way to make an infinite loop.
        
        An example use case of break:
        An infinite while loop can be used to continuously take user input. For example, you are making a calculator and need to take numbers from the user to add and stop, when the user enters ""stop"".
        In this case, the break statement can be used to end the infinite loop when the user input equals ""stop"".
        
        Using the break statement outside of a loop causes an error.
        
        Another statement that can be used within loops is continue.
        Unlike break, continue jumps back to the top of the loop, rather than stopping it. Basically, the continue statement stops the current iteration and continues with the next one.
        
        For example:
        i = 0
        while i<5:
          i += 1
          if i==3:
            print(""Skipping 3"")
            continue
          print(i)
        
        An example use case of continue:
        An airline ticketing system needs to calculate the total cost for all tickets purchased. The tickets for children under the age of 1 are free. We can use a while loop to iterate through the list of passengers and calculate the total cost of their tickets. Here, the continue statement can be used to skip the children.
        
        Using the continue statement outside of a loop causes an error.

        <tr><td>	for Loops	</td><td>	"The for loop is used to iterate over a given sequence, such as lists or strings.
        
        The code below outputs each item in the list and adds an exclamation mark at the end:
        words = [""hello"", ""world"", ""spam"", ""eggs""]
        for word in words:
            print(word + ""!"")
        
        In the code above, the word variable represents the corresponding item of the list in each iteration of the loop.
        During the 1st iteration, word is equal to ""hello"", and during the 2nd iteration it's equal to ""world"", and so on.
        
        The for loop can be used to iterate over strings.
        
        For example:
        str = ""testing for loops""
        count = 0
        
        for x in str:
           if(x == 't'):
            count += 1
        
        print(count)
        
        The code above defines a count variable, iterates over the string and calculates the count of 't' letters in it. During each iteration, the x variable represents the current letter of the string.
        The count variable is incremented each time the letter 't' is found, thus, at the end of the loop it represents the number of 't' letters in the string.
        
        Similar to while loops, the break and continue statements can be used in for loops, to stop the loop or jump to the next iteration.
        
        Both, for and while loops can be used to execute a block of code for multiple times.
        
        It is common to use the for loop when the number of iterations is fixed. For example, iterating over a fixed list of items in a shopping list.
        
        The while loop is used in cases when the number of iterations is not known and depends on some calculations and conditions in the code block of the loop.
        For example, ending the loop when the user enters a specific input in a calculator program.
        
        Both, for and while loops can be used to achieve the same results, however, the for loop has cleaner and shorter syntax, making it a better choice in most cases.

        By default, it starts from 0, increments by 1 and stops before the specified number.
        
        The code below generates a list containing all of the integers, up to 10.
        numbers = list(range(10))
        print(numbers)
        
        In order to output the range as a list, we need to explicitly convert it to a list, using the list() function.
        
        If range is called with one argument, it produces an object with values from 0 to that argument.
        If it is called with two arguments, it produces values from the first to the second.
        
        For example:
        numbers = list(range(3, 8))
        print(numbers)
        print(range(20) == range(0, 20))
        
        Remember, the second argument is not included in the range, so range(3, 8) will not include the number 8.
        
        range can have a third argument, which determines the interval of the sequence produced, also called the step.
        numbers = list(range(5, 20, 2))
        print(numbers)
        
        We can also create list of decreasing numbers, using a negative number as the third argument, for example list(range(20, 5, -2)).
        
        The for loop is commonly used to repeat some code a certain number of times. This is done by combining for loops with range objects.
        for i in range(5):
            print(""hello!"")

        The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
        You must define functions before they are called, in the same way that you must assign variables before using them.

        <tr><td>	Arguments	</td><td>	"All the function definitions we've looked at so far have been functions of zero arguments, which are called with empty parentheses.
        However, most functions take arguments.

        def print_with_exclamation(word):

        print_with_exclamation(""eggs"")
        print_with_exclamation(""python"")
        
        As you can see, the argument is defined inside the parentheses.
        You can also define functions with more than one argument; separate them with commas.
        
        def print_sum_twice(x, y):
           print(x + y)
           print(x + y)
        
        print_sum_twice(5, 8)
        
        Function arguments can be used as variables inside the function definition. However, they cannot be referenced outside of the function's definition. This also applies to other variables created inside a function.
        
        def function(variable):
            variable += 1
            print(variable)
        
        function(7)
        print(variable)
        
        This code will throw an error because the variable is defined inside the function and can be referenced only there.

        The basic way to use a module is to add import module_name at the top of your code, and then using module_name.var to access functions and values with the name var in the module.
        For example, the following example uses the random module to generate random numbers:
        
        import random
        
        for i in range(5):
            value = random.randint(1, 6)
            print(value)
        
        The code uses the randint function defined in the random module to print 5 random numbers in the range 1 to 6.
        
        There is another kind of import that can be used if you only need certain functions from a module.
        These take the form from module_name import var, and then var can be used as if it were defined normally in your code.
        For example, to import only the pi constant from the math module:
        
        from math import pi
        
        print(pi)
        
        Use a comma separated list to import multiple objects. For example:
        from math import pi, sqrt
        
        * imports all objects from a module. For example: from math import *
        This is generally discouraged, as it confuses variables in your code with variables in the external module.
        
        Trying to import a module that isn't available causes an ImportError.
        
        You can import a module or object under a different name using the as keyword. This is mainly used when a module or object has a long or confusing name.

        Tasks that can be done by the standard library include string parsing, data serialization, testing, debugging and manipulating dates, emails, command line arguments, and much more!
        
        Python's extensive standard library is one of its main strengths as a language.
        
        The Standard Library
        Some of the modules in the standard library are written in Python, and some are written in C.
        Most are available on all platforms, but some are Windows or Unix specific.
        
        We won't cover all of the modules in the standard library; there are simply too many. The complete documentation for the standard library is available online at www.python.org.
        
        Modules
        Many third-party Python modules are stored on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
        The best way to install these is using a program called pip. This comes installed by default with modern distributions of Python. If you don't have it, it is easy to install online. Once you have it, installing libraries from PyPI is easy. Look up the name of the library you want to install, go to the command line (for Windows it will be the Command Prompt), and enter pip install library_name. Once you've done this, import the library and use it in your code.
        
        Using pip is the standard way of installing libraries on most operating systems, but some libraries have prebuilt binaries for Windows. These are normal executable files that let you install libraries with a GUI the same way you would install other programs.
        
        It's important to enter pip commands at the command line, not the Python interpreter."	</td><td>		</td></tr>

        num1 = 7
        num2 = 0
        print(num1/num2)
        
        Different exceptions are raised for different reasons.
        Common exceptions:
        ImportError: an import fails;
        IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;
        NameError: an unknown variable is used;
        SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly;
        TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;
        ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.
        
        Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError and OSError. Third-party libraries also often define their own exceptions."	</td><td>		</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Exception Handling	</td><td>	"To handle exceptions, and to call code when an exception occurs, you can use a try/except statement.
        The try block contains code that might throw an exception. If that exception occurs, the code in the try block stops being executed, and the code in the except block is run. If no error occurs, the code in the except block doesn't run.
        
        For example:
        try:
            num1 = 7
            num2 = 0

            print(""An error occurred"")
            print(""due to zero division"")
        
        In the code above, the except statement defines the type of exception to handle (in our case, the ZeroDivisionError).
        
        A try statement can have multiple different except blocks to handle different exceptions.
        Multiple exceptions can also be put into a single except block using parentheses, to have the except block handle all of them.
        
        try:
            variable = 10

        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            print(""Error occurred"")
        
        An except statement without any exception specified will catch all errors. These should be used sparingly, as they can catch unexpected errors and hide programming mistakes.
        
        For example:
        try:
            word = ""spam""

        Text files are the easiest to manipulate. Before a file can be edited, it must be opened, using the open function.
        
        myfile = open(""filename.txt"")
        
        The argument of the open function is the path to the file. If the file is in the current working directory of the program, you can specify only its name.
        
        You can specify the mode used to open a file by applying a second argument to the open function.
        Sending ""r"" means open in read mode, which is the default.
        Sending ""w"" means write mode, for rewriting the contents of a file.
        Sending ""a"" means append mode, for adding new content to the end of the file.
        
        Adding ""b"" to a mode opens it in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (such as image and sound files).
        
        For example:
        # write mode
        open(""filename.txt"", ""w"")
        
        # read mode

        # binary write mode
        open(""filename.txt"", ""wb"")
        
        You can use the + sign with each of the modes above to give them extra access to files. For example, r+ opens the file for both reading and writing.
        
        Once a file has been opened and used, you should close it.
        This is done with the close method of the file object.

        This will print all of the contents of the file ""filename.txt"".
        
        To read only a certain amount of a file, you can provide a number as an argument to the read function. This determines the number of bytes that should be read.
        You can make more calls to read on the same file object to read more of the file byte by byte. With no argument, read returns the rest of the file.
        
        file = open(""filename.txt"", ""r"")

        To retrieve each line in a file, you can use the readlines method to return a list in which each element is a line in the file.
        
        For example:

        You can also use a for loop to iterate through the lines in the file:
        
        file = open(""filename.txt"", ""r"")
        
        for line in file:
            print(line)

        Line 2 text

        print(file.read())
        file.close()
        
        The ""w"" mode will create a file, if it does not already exist.
        
        When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is deleted.
        file = open(""newfile.txt"", ""w"")

        print(file.read())
        print(""Finished"")
        file.close()
        
        The write method returns the number of bytes written to a file, if successful.
        
        msg = ""Hello world!""
        file = open(""newfile.txt"", ""w"")
        amount_written = file.write(msg)

        Lists can be thought of as dictionaries with integer keys within a certain range.
        Dictionaries can be indexed in the same way as lists, using square brackets containing keys.
        
        Example:
        ages = {""Dave"": 24, ""Mary"": 42, ""John"": 58}
        print(ages[""Dave""])
        print(ages[""Mary""])
        
        Each element in a dictionary is represented by a key:value pair.
        
        Trying to index a key that isn't part of the dictionary returns a KeyError.
        
        Example:
        primary = {

        An empty dictionary is defined as {}.
        
        Only immutable objects can be used as keys to dictionaries. Immutable objects are those that can't be changed. So far, the only mutable objects you've come across are lists and dictionaries. Trying to use a mutable object as a dictionary key causes a TypeError.

        If the first number in a slice is omitted, it is taken to be the start of the list.
        If the second number is omitted, it is taken to be the end.

        Slicing can also be done on tuples.
        
        List slices can also have a third number, representing the step, to include only alternate values in the slice.

        Negative values can be used in list slicing (and normal list indexing). When negative values are used for the first and second values in a slice (or a normal index), they count from the end of the list.

        Using pure functions has both advantages and disadvantages.
        Pure functions are:
        - easier to reason about and test.
        - more efficient. Once the function has been evaluated for an input, the result can be stored and referred to the next time the function of that input is needed, reducing the number of times the function is called. This is called memoization.
        - easier to run in parallel.

        The same is possible with functions, provided that they are created using lambda syntax. Functions created this way are known as anonymous.
        This approach is most commonly used when passing a simple function as an argument to another function. The syntax is shown in the next example and consists of the lambda keyword followed by a list of arguments, a colon, and the expression to evaluate and return.

        Lambda functions aren't as powerful as named functions.
        They can only do things that require a single expression - usually equivalent to a single line of code.
        
        Example:

        print((lambda x: x**2 + 5*x + 4) (-4))
        
        In the code above, we created an anonymous function on the fly and called it with an argument.

        for i in countdown():
            print(i)
        
        The yield statement is used to define a generator, replacing the return of a function to provide a result to its caller without destroying local variables.
        
        Due to the fact that they yield one item at a time, generators don't have the memory restrictions of lists.
        In fact, they can be infinite!
        In short, generators allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop.

        <tr><td>	Decorators	</td><td>	"Decorators provide a way to modify functions using other functions.
        This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions that you don't want to modify.
        
        Example:
        def decor(func):
          def wrap():
            print(""============"")
            func()
            print(""============"")

          print(""Hello world!"")
        
        decorated = decor(print_text)
        decorated()
        
        We defined a function named decor that has a single parameter func. Inside decor, we defined a nested function named wrap. The wrap function will print a string, then call func(), and print another string. The decor function returns the wrap function as its result.
        We could say that the variable decorated is a decorated version of print_text - it's print_text plus something.
        In fact, if we wrote a useful decorator we might want to replace print_text with the decorated version altogether so we always got our ""plus something"" version of print_text.
        This is done by re-assigning the variable that contains our function:
        
        def decor(func):
            def wrap():
                print(""============"")
                func()
                print(""============"")
            return wrap
        
        def print_text():
            print(""Hello world!"")
        
        print_text = decor(print_text)
        print_text()
        
        Now print_text corresponds to our decorated version.
        
        In our previous example, we decorated our function by replacing the variable containing the function with a wrapped version.
        
        def decor(func):
            def wrap():
                print(""============"")
                func()
                print(""============"")

        def print_text():
            print(""Hello world!"")
        
        print_text = decor(print_text)
        
        print_text();
        
        This pattern can be used at any time, to wrap any function.
        Python provides support to wrap a function in a decorator by pre-pending the function definition with a decorator name and the @ symbol.
        If we are defining a function we can ""decorate"" it with the @ symbol like:
        
        def decor(func):
            def wrap():
                print(""============"")
                func()

        print_text = decor(print_text)

        <tr><td>	Recursion	</td><td>	"Recursion is a very important concept in functional programming.
        The fundamental part of recursion is self-reference - functions calling themselves. It is used to solve problems that can be broken up into easier sub-problems of the same type.
        
        A classic example of a function that is implemented recursively is the factorial function, which finds the product of all positive integers below a specified number.
        For example, 5! (5 factorial) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 (120). To implement this recursively, notice that 5! = 5 * 4!, 4! = 4 * 3!, 3! = 3 * 2!, and so on. Generally, n! = n * (n-1)!.
        Furthermore, 1! = 1. This is known as the base case, as it can be calculated without performing any more factorials.
        Below is a recursive implementation of the factorial function.
        
        def factorial(x):
            if x == 1:
                return 1
            else: 
                return x * factorial(x-1)
        
        print(factorial(5))
        
        The base case acts as the exit condition of the recursion.
        
        Recursive functions can be infinite, just like infinite while loops. These often occur when you forget to implement the base case.
        Below is an incorrect version of the factorial function. It has no base case, so it runs until the interpreter runs out of memory and crashes.
        
        def factorial(x):
            return x * factorial(x-1)
        
        print(factorial(5))
        
        Recursion can also be indirect. One function can call a second, which calls the first, which calls the second, and so on. This can occur with any number of functions.
        
        Example:
        def is_even(x):
            if x == 0:

        To create an empty set, you must use set(), as {} creates an empty dictionary.
        
        Sets differ from lists in several ways, but share several list operations such as len.
        They are unordered, which means that they can't be indexed.
        They cannot contain duplicate elements.
        Due to the way they're stored, it's faster to check whether an item is part of a set, rather than part of a list.
        Instead of using append to add to a set, use add.
        The method remove removes a specific element from a set; pop removes an arbitrary element.

        - Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
        - Use tuples when your data cannot change.

        The function repeat repeats an object, either infinitely or a specific number of times.

        Some examples:
        takewhile - takes items from an iterable while a predicate function remains true;
        chain - combines several iterables into one long one;

        <tr><td>	Classes	</td><td>	"We have previously looked at two paradigms of programming - imperative (using statements, loops, and functions as subroutines), and functional (using pure functions, higher-order functions, and recursion).
        
        Another very popular paradigm is object-oriented programming (OOP).
        Objects are created using classes, which are actually the focal point of OOP.
        The class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself. In other words, a class can be described as an object's blueprint, description, or definition.
        You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple different objects.
        
        Classes are created using the keyword class and an indented block, which contains class methods (which are functions).
        Below is an example of a simple class and its objects.
        
        class Cat:
          def __init__(self, color, legs):
            self.color = color
            self.legs = legs

        rover = Cat(""dog-colored"", 4)
        stumpy = Cat(""brown"", 3)
        
        This code defines a class named Cat, which has two attributes: color and legs.
        Then the class is used to create 3 separate objects of that class.

        <tr><td>	__init__	</td><td>	"The __init__ method is the most important method in a class.
        This is called when an instance (object) of the class is created, using the class name as a function.
        
        All methods must have self as their first parameter, although it isn't explicitly passed, Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods. Within a method definition, self refers to the instance calling the method.
        
        Instances of a class have attributes, which are pieces of data associated with them.
        In this example, Cat instances have attributes color and legs. These can be accessed by putting a dot, and the attribute name after an instance.
        In an __init__ method, self.attribute can therefore be used to set the initial value of an instance's attributes.
        
        Example:
        class Cat:
            def __init__(self, color, legs):
                self.color = color
                self.legs = legs
        
        felix = Cat(""ginger"", 4)
        print(felix.color)
        
        In the example above, the __init__ method takes two arguments and assigns them to the object's attributes. The __init__ method is called the class constructor.
        
        class Student:
            def __init__(self, name):

        Remember, that all methods must have self as their first parameter.
        These methods are accessed using the same dot syntax as attributes.
        
        Example:
        class Dog:
          def __init__(self, name, color):
            self.name = name

        fido.bark()
        
        Classes can also have class attributes, created by assigning variables within the body of the class. These can be accessed either from instances of the class, or the class itself.
        
        Example:
        class Dog:
            legs = 4
            def __init__(self, name, color):

        Class attributes are shared by all instances of the class.
        
        Trying to access an attribute of an instance that isn't defined causes an AttributeError. This also applies when you call an undefined method.

        Imagine several classes, Cat, Dog, Rabbit and so on. Although they may differ in some ways (only Dog might have the method bark), they are likely to be similar in others (all having the attributes color and name).
        This similarity can be expressed by making them all inherit from a superclass Animal, which contains the shared functionality.
        To inherit a class from another class, put the superclass name in parentheses after the class name.

        A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass.
        A class that is inherited from is called a superclass.
        If a class inherits from another with the same attributes or methods, it overrides them.
        
        class Wolf:

        husky.bark()
        OUTPUT
        Woof
        
        The reason the `husky.bark()` call prints `""Woof""` instead of `""Grr...""` is because the `Dog` class **overrides** the `bark` method from its parent class, `Wolf`.
        
        ### Key Concepts:
        1. **Inheritance:**
           - The `Dog` class inherits from the `Wolf` class, so all methods and attributes of `Wolf` are available to `Dog` unless overridden.
        
        2. **Method Overriding:**
           - When a subclass (like `Dog`) defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class (`Wolf`), the subclass's method takes precedence. This is called **method overriding**.
        
        3. **Instance Behavior:**
           - When `husky.bark()` is called, Python looks for the `bark` method in the `Dog` class first. Since the `Dog` class has its own `bark` method, it uses that instead of the one in `Wolf`.
        
        ### Why doesn't it use `Wolf.bark`?
        The method lookup follows the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**. Python checks methods in the following order:
        1. The class of the instance (`Dog` in this case).
        2. The parent class (`Wolf`).
        
        Since `Dog` defines its own `bark` method, Python doesn't need to check `Wolf`.
        
        If you want the `Dog` class to call the `bark` method from `Wolf`, you can explicitly invoke it using `super()`:
        
        ```python
        class Dog(Wolf):
            def bark(self):
                super().bark()  # Calls the `bark` method from `Wolf`
                print(""Woof"")
        ```
        
        Now, `husky.bark()` would print:
        ```
        Grr...
        Woof
        ```
        
        ### Summary:
        - The `Dog` class overrides the `bark` method from `Wolf`, so `husky.bark()` calls the overridden version in `Dog`.
        - The `bark` method is not ""inherited"" in the sense that it's replaced in the subclass.
        - You can use `super()` to call the parent class's method explicitly.

        The function super is a useful inheritance-related function that refers to the parent class. It can be used to find the method with a certain name in an object's superclass.
        super().spam() calls the spam method of the superclass.

        <tr><td>	Magic Methods & Operator Overloading	</td><td>	"Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names.
        They are also known as dunders.
        So far, the only one we have encountered is __init__, but there are several others.
        They are used to create functionality that can't be represented as a normal method.
        
        One common use of them is operator overloading.
        This means defining operators for custom classes that allow operators such as + and * to be used on them.
        An example magic method is __add__ for +.
        
        class Vector2D:
            def __init__(self, x, y):
                self.x = x
                self.y = y
            def __add__(self, other):
                return Vector2D(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
        
        first = Vector2D(5, 7)
        second = Vector2D(3, 9)
        result = first + second
        print(result.x)
        print(result.y)
        OUTPUT
        8
        16
        
        The __add__ method allows for the definition of a custom behavior for the + operator in our class.
        As you can see, it adds the corresponding attributes of the objects and returns a new object, containing the result.
        Once it's defined, we can add two objects of the class together.
        
        More magic methods for common operators:
        __sub__ for -
        __mul__ for *
        __truediv__ for /
        __floordiv__ for //
        __mod__ for %
        __pow__ for **
        __and__ for &
        __xor__ for ^
        __or__ for |
        __lt__ for <
        __le__ for <=
        __eq__ for ==
        __ne__ for !=
        __gt__ for >
        __ge__ for >=
        __len__ for len()
        __getitem__ for indexing
        __setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
        __delitem__ for deleting indexed values
        __iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
        __contains__ for in
        
        The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y).
        However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called.
        There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.
        In the example below, we defined the division operation for our class SpecialString.
        
        Example:
        class SpecialString:
            def __init__(self, cont):
                self.cont = cont
        
            def __truediv__(self, other):
                line = ""="" * len(other.cont)
                return ""\n"".join([self.cont, line, other.cont])
        
        spam = SpecialString(""spam"")
        hello = SpecialString(""Hello world!"")
        print(spam / hello)
        --------------------------
        class BankAccount:
           def __init__(self, balance):
               self.balance = balance
           def __add__(self, other):
               return BankAccount(self.balance + other.balance)
        a = BankAccount(1024)
        b = BankAccount(42)
        
        result = a + b
        print(result.balance)
        --------------------------
        Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.
        __lt__ for <
        __le__ for <=
        __eq__ for ==
        __ne__ for !=
        __gt__ for >
        __ge__ for >=
        
        If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __eq__.
        There are no other relationships between the other operators.
        
        Example:
        class SpecialString:
            def __init__(self, cont):
                self.cont = cont
        
            def __gt__(self, other):
                for index in range(len(other.cont)+1):
                    result = other.cont[:index] + "">"" + self.cont
                    result += "">"" + other.cont[index:]
                    print(result)
        
        spam = SpecialString(""spam"")
        eggs = SpecialString(""eggs"")
        spam > eggs
        --------------------------
        There are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.
        __len__ for len()
        __getitem__ for indexing
        __setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
        __delitem__ for deleting indexed values
        __iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
        __contains__ for in
        
        There are many other magic methods that we won't cover here, such as __call__ for calling objects as functions, and __int__, __str__, and the like, for converting objects to built-in types.
        
        Example:
        import random
        
        class VagueList:
            def __init__(self, cont):
                self.cont = cont
        
            def __getitem__(self, index):
                return self.cont[index + random.randint(-1, 1)]
        
            def __len__(self):
                return random.randint(0, len(self.cont)*2)
        
        vague_list = VagueList([""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E""])
        print(len(vague_list))
        print(len(vague_list))
        print(vague_list[2])
        print(vague_list[2])
        
        We have overridden the len() function for the class VagueList to return a random number.
        The indexing function also returns a random item in a range from the list, based on the expression.

        <tr><td>	Object Lifecycle	</td><td>	"The lifecycle of an object is made up of its creation, manipulation, and destruction.
        
        The first stage of the life-cycle of an object is the definition of the class to which it belongs.
        The next stage is the instantiation of an instance, when __init__ is called. Memory is allocated to store the instance. Just before this occurs, the __new__ method of the class is called. This is usually overridden only in special cases.
        After this has happened, the object is ready to be used.
        
        Other code can then interact with the object, by calling functions on it and accessing its attributes.
        Eventually, it will finish being used, and can be destroyed.
        
        When an object is destroyed, the memory allocated to it is freed up, and can be used for other purposes.
        Destruction of an object occurs when its reference count reaches zero. Reference count is the number of variables and other elements that refer to an object.
        If nothing is referring to it (it has a reference count of zero) nothing can interact with it, so it can be safely deleted.
        
        In some situations, two (or more) objects can be referred to by each other only, and therefore can be deleted as well.
        The del statement reduces the reference count of an object by one, and this often leads to its deletion.
        The magic method for the del statement is __del__.
        The process of deleting objects when they are no longer needed is called garbage collection.
        In summary, an object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object's reference count decreases when it's deleted with del, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python automatically deletes it.
        Example:
        a = 42  # Create object <42>
        b = a  # Increase ref. count  of <42> 
        c = [a]  # Increase ref. count  of <42> 
        
        del a  # Decrease ref. count  of <42>
        b = 100  # Decrease ref. count  of <42> 
        c[0] = -1  # Decrease ref. count  of <42>
        
        Lower level languages like C don't have this kind of automatic memory management."	</td><td>	del instance	</td></tr>
        <tr><td>	Data Hiding	</td><td>	"A key part of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, which involves packaging of related variables and functions into a single easy-to-use object - an instance of a class.
        A related concept is data hiding, which states that implementation details of a class should be hidden, and a clean standard interface be presented for those who want to use the class.
        In other programming languages, this is usually done with private methods and attributes, which block external access to certain methods and attributes in a class.
        
        The Python philosophy is slightly different. It is often stated as ""we are all consenting adults here"", meaning that you shouldn't put arbitrary restrictions on accessing parts of a class. Hence there are no ways of enforcing a method or attribute be strictly private.
        
        However, there are ways to discourage people from accessing parts of a class, such as by denoting that it is an implementation detail, and should be used at their own risk.
        
        Weakly private methods and attributes have a single underscore at the beginning.
        This signals that they are private, and shouldn't be used by external code. However, it is mostly only a convention, and does not stop external code from accessing them.
        Its only actual effect is that from module_name import * won't import variables that start with a single underscore.
        
        Example:
        class Queue:
            def __init__(self, contents):
                self._hiddenlist = list(contents)
        
            def push(self, value):
                self._hiddenlist.insert(0, value)
        
            def pop(self):
                return self._hiddenlist.pop(-1)
        
            def __repr__(self):
                return ""Queue({})"".format(self._hiddenlist)
        
        queue = Queue([1, 2, 3])
        print(queue)
        queue.push(0)
        print(queue)
        queue.pop()
        print(queue)
        print(queue._hiddenlist)
        
        In the code above, the attribute _hiddenlist is marked as private, but it can still be accessed in the outside code.
        The __repr__ magic method is used for string representation of the instance.
        
        Strongly private methods and attributes have a double underscore at the beginning of their names. This causes their names to be mangled, which means that they can't be accessed from outside the class.
        The purpose of this isn't to ensure that they are kept private, but to avoid bugs if there are subclasses that have methods or attributes with the same names.
        Name mangled methods can still be accessed externally, but by a different name. The method __privatemethod of class Spam could be accessed externally with _Spam__privatemethod.
        
        Example:
        class Spam:
            __egg = 7
            def print_egg(self):
                print(self.__egg)
        
        s = Spam()
        s.print_egg()
        print(s._Spam__egg)
        print(s.__egg)
        
        Basically, Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name.

        Data Hiding
        You are given a BankAccount class and need to add a deposit() method to it, which adds the given amount to the private balance property.
        
        The code should declare a BankAccount object with an initial balance of 0, take a number from user input, add it to the balance using the deposit() method, and output the object.
        
        Complete the required deposit() method so the code works as expected and produces the required output.
        
        Remember, the methods in a class need to have self as their first parameter, which is used to access the properties.
        
        class BankAccount:
            def __init__(self, balance):

        Class methods are different - they are called by a class, which is passed to the cls parameter of the method.
        A common use of these are factory methods, which instantiate an instance of a class, using different parameters than those usually passed to the class constructor.
        Class methods are marked with a classmethod decorator.
        
        Example:
        class Rectangle:
            def __init__(self, width, height):
                self.width = width

        square = Rectangle.new_square(5)
        print(square.calculate_area())
        
        new_square is a class method and is called on the class, rather than on an instance of the class. It returns a new object of the class cls.
        
        Technically, the parameters self and cls are just conventions; they could be changed to anything else. However, they are universally followed, so it is wise to stick to using them."	</td><td>	"class Rectangle:

        They are created by putting the property decorator above a method, which means when the instance attribute with the same name as the method is accessed, the method will be called instead.
        One common use of a property is to make an attribute read-only.
        
        Example:

        Properties can also be set by defining setter/getter functions.
        The setter function sets the corresponding property's value.
        The getter gets the value.
        To define a setter, you need to use a decorator of the same name as the property, followed by a dot and the setter keyword.
        The same applies to defining getter functions.

        Let's look at an example project that shows how classes are used in game development.
        The game to be developed is an old fashioned text-based adventure game.
        Below is the function handling input and simple parsing.
        
        def get_input():
          command = input("": "").split()
          verb_word = command[0]
          if verb_word in verb_dict:
            verb = verb_dict[verb_word]
          else:
            print(""Unknown verb {}"". format(verb_word))
            return
        
          if len(command) >= 2:
            noun_word = command[1]
            print (verb(noun_word))
          else:
            print(verb(""nothing""))
        
        def say(noun):
          return 'You said ""{}""'.format(noun)
        
        verb_dict = {
          ""say"": say,
        }
        
        while True:
          get_input()
        
        The code above takes input from the user, and tries to match the first word with a command in verb_dict. If a match is found, the corresponding function is called.
        
        The next step is to use classes to represent game objects.
        class GameObject:
          class_name = """"
          desc = """"
          objects = {}
        
          def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self
        
          def get_desc(self):
            return self.class_name + ""\n"" + self.desc
        
        class Goblin(GameObject):
          class_name = ""goblin""
          desc = ""A foul creature""
        
        goblin = Goblin(""Gobbly"")
        
        def examine(noun):
          if noun in GameObject.objects:
            return GameObject.objects[noun].get_desc()
          else:
            return ""There is no {} here."".format(noun)
        
        We created a Goblin class, which inherits from the GameObjects class.
        We also created a new function examine, which returns the objects description.
        Now we can add a new ""examine"" verb to our dictionary and try it out!
        
        verb_dict = {
          ""say"": say,
          ""examine"": examine,
        }
        
        Combine this code with the one in our previous example, and run the program.

        You said ""Hello!""

        <tr><td>	Regular expressions	</td><td>	"Regular Expressions
        Regular expressions are a powerful tool for various kinds of string manipulation.
        They are a domain specific language (DSL) that is present as a library in most modern programming languages, not just Python.
        They are useful for two main tasks:
        - verifying that strings match a pattern (for instance, that a string has the format of an email address),
        - performing substitutions in a string (such as changing all American spellings to British ones).
        
        Domain specific languages are highly specialized mini programming languages.
        Regular expressions are a popular example, and SQL (for database manipulation) is another.
        Private domain-specific languages are often used for specific industrial purposes.
        Regular expressions in Python can be accessed using the re module, which is part of the standard library.
        After you've defined a regular expression, the re.match function can be used to determine whether it matches at the beginning of a string.
        If it does, match returns an object representing the match, if not, it returns None.
        To avoid any confusion while working with regular expressions, we would use raw strings as r""expression"".
        Raw strings don't escape anything, which makes use of regular expressions easier.
        
        Example:
        
        import re
        
        pattern = r""spam""
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""spamspamspam""):
            print(""Match"")
        else:
            print(""No match"")
        
        OUTPUT
        Match
        
        The above example checks if the pattern ""spam"" matches the string and prints ""Match"" if it does.
        
        Here the pattern is a simple word, but there are various characters, which would have special meaning when they are used in a regular expression.
        
        Other functions to match patterns are re.search and re.findall.
        The function re.search finds a match of a pattern anywhere in the string.
        The function re.findall returns a list of all substrings that match a pattern.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""spam""
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""eggspamsausagespam""):
            print(""Match"")
        else:
            print(""No match"")
        
        if re.search(pattern, ""eggspamsausagespam""):
            print(""Match"")
        else:
            print(""No match"")
        
        print(re.findall(pattern, ""eggspamsausagespam""))
        
        OUTPUT
        No match
        Match
        ['spam', 'spam']
        
        In the example above, the match function did not match the pattern, as it looks at the beginning of the string.
        The search function found a match in the string.
        
        The function re.finditer does the same thing as re.findall, except it returns an iterator, rather than a list.
        
        The regex search returns an object with several methods that give details about it.
        These methods include group which returns the string matched, start and end which return the start and ending positions of the first match, and span which returns the start and end positions of the first match as a tuple.
        
        Example:
        
        import re
        
        pattern = r""pam""
        
        match = re.search(pattern, ""eggspamsausage"")
        if match:
            print(match.group())
            print(match.start())
            print(match.end())
            print(match.span())
        
        OUTPUT
        pam
        4
        7
        (4, 7)
        
        One of the most important re methods that use regular expressions is sub.
        
        Syntax:
        re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0)
        
        This method replaces all occurrences of the pattern in string with repl, substituting all occurrences, unless count provided. This method returns the modified string.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        str = ""My name is David. Hi David.""
        pattern = r""David""
        newstr = re.sub(pattern, ""Amy"", str)
        print(newstr)
        
        OUTPUT
        My name is Amy. Hi Amy.

        We need to create a number formatting system for a contacts database.
        Create a program that will take the phone number as input, and if the number starts with ""00"", replace them with ""+"".
        The number should be printed after formatting.
        
        Sample Input
        0014860098
        
        Sample Output
        +14860098
        
        Notice that here you shouldn't convert the input string to integer, because you will work with symbols.
        
        import re

        <tr><td>	Simple Metacharacters	</td><td>	"Metacharacters are what make regular expressions more powerful than normal string methods.
        They allow you to create regular expressions to represent concepts like ""one or more repetitions of a vowel"".
        
        The existence of metacharacters poses a problem if you want to create a regular expression (or regex) that matches a literal metacharacter, such as ""$"". You can do this by escaping the metacharacters by putting a backslash in front of them.
        However, this can cause problems, since backslashes also have an escaping function in normal Python strings. This can mean putting three or four backslashes in a row to do all the escaping.
        
        To avoid this, you can use a raw string, which is a normal string with an ""r"" in front of it. We saw usage of raw strings in the previous lesson.
        
        Raw string: str = r""I am \r\a\w!""
        
        The first metacharacter we will look at is . (dot).
        This matches any character, other than a new line.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""gr.y""
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""grey""):
            print(""Match 1"")
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""gray""):
            print(""Match 2"")
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""blue""):
            print(""Match 3"")
        
        OUTPUT
        Match 1
        Match 2
        
        .... means any four character string without newline
        
        The next two metacharacters are ^ and $.
        These match the start and end of a string, respectively.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""^gr.y$""
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""grey""):
            print(""Match 1"")
        
        if re.match(pattern, ""gray""):

        if re.match(pattern, ""stingray""):
            print(""Match 3"")
        
        OUTPUT
        Match 1
        Match 2
        
        The pattern ""^gr.y$"" means that the string should start with gr, then follow with any character, except a newline, and end with y.

        A character class is created by putting the characters it matches inside square brackets.

        Match 1
        Match 2
        
        The pattern [aeiou] in the search function matches all strings that contain any one of the characters defined.
        
        [abc][def] woud match any letter out of abc, then any letter from def
        
        Character classes can also match ranges of characters.
        Some examples:
        The class [a-z] matches any lowercase alphabetic character.
        The class [G-P] matches any uppercase character from G to P.
        The class [0-9] matches any digit.
        Multiple ranges can be included in one class. For example, [A-Za-z] matches a letter of any case.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""[A-Z][A-Z][0-9]""  # The pattern in the example above matches strings that contain two alphabetic uppercase letters followed by a digit.

        [1-5][0-9] match any two digit number from 10 to 59
        
        Place a ^ at the start of a character class to invert it.
        This causes it to match any character other than the ones included.
        Other metacharacters such as $ and ., have no meaning within character classes.
        The metacharacter ^ has no meaning unless it is the first character in a class.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""[^A-Z]""

        OUTPUT
        Match 1

        Curly braces can be used to represent the number of repetitions between two numbers.
        The regex {x,y} means ""between x and y repetitions of something"".
        Hence {0,1} is the same thing as ?.
        If the first number is missing, it is taken to be zero. If the second number is missing, it is taken to be infinity.

        One or more repetitions of non-vowel, a vowel and a non-vowel
        
        The content of groups in a match can be accessed using the group function.
        A call of group(0) or group() returns the whole match.
        A call of group(n), where n is greater than 0, returns the nth group from the left.
        The method groups() returns all groups up from 1.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""a(bc)(de)(f(g)h)i""

        Groups can be nested
        
        What would group(3) be of a match of 1(23)(4(56)78)9(0)?
        56
        Your answer is correct because `group(3)` refers to the third set of parentheses in the regex match. In your example, `(4(56))` is the second group, and within that, `(56)` is the third group. Thus, `group(3)` correctly returns `56`. 
        
        There are several kinds of special groups.
        Two useful ones are named groups and non-capturing groups.
        Named groups have the format (?P<name>...), where name is the name of the group, and ... is the content. They behave exactly the same as normal groups, except they can be accessed by group(name) in addition to its number.
        Non-capturing groups have the format (?:...). They are not accessible by the group method, so they can be added to an existing regular expression without breaking the numbering.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""(?P<first>abc)(?:def)(ghi)""
        
        match = re.match(pattern, ""abcdefghi"")
        if match:
            print(match.group(""first""))
            print(match.groups())
        
        OUTPUT
        abc
        ('abc', 'ghi')
        
        What would be the result of len(match.groups()) of a match of (a)(b(?:c)(d)(?:e))?
        3
        The `match.groups()` method returns a tuple of all captured groups, including both regular and non-capturing groups.
        
        Another important metacharacter is |.
        This means ""or"", so red|blue matches either ""red"" or ""blue"".
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""gr(a|e)y""
        
        match = re.match(pattern, ""gray"")

        <tr><td>	Special Sequences	</td><td>	"There are various special sequences you can use in regular expressions. They are written as a backslash followed by another character.
        One useful special sequence is a backslash and a number between 1 and 99, e.g., \1 or \17. This matches the expression of the group of that number.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""(.+) \1""
        
        match = re.match(pattern, ""word word"")

        Match 2
        
        Note, that ""(.+) \1"" is not the same as ""(.+) (.+)"", because \1 refers to the first group's subexpression, which is the matched expression itself, and not the regex pattern.
        
        What would (abc|xyz)\1 match?
        ""abc"" or ""xyz"", followed by the same thing
        
        More useful special sequences are \d, \s, and \w.
        These match digits, whitespace, and word characters respectively.
        In ASCII mode they are equivalent to [0-9], [ \t\n\r\f\v], and [a-zA-Z0-9_].
        In Unicode mode they match certain other characters, as well. For instance, \w matches letters with accents.
        Versions of these special sequences with upper case letters - \D, \S, and \W - mean the opposite to the lower-case versions. For instance, \D matches anything that isn't a digit.
        
        Example:
        import re
        
        pattern = r""(\D+\d)""
        
        match = re.match(pattern, ""Hi 999!"")

        Match 1
        
        (\D+\d) matches one or more non-digits followed by a digit.

        You are a social media marketing specialist doing research on social networks.

        Sample Output
        #pressure
        #diamonds
        
        Remember that the re.findall() method returns a list of all substrings that match a pattern. So, you can use the regex r""#\w+"" to find all words that start with a hashtag and output them on separate lines.
        
        import re
        
        text = input()
        match = re.findall(r""#\w+"", text)

        But it matches with:
        [1-6!] and
        (\d*\W)+
        
        Additional special sequences are \A, \Z, and \b.
        The sequences \A and \Z match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.
        The sequence \b matches the empty string between \w and \W characters, or \w characters and the beginning or end of the string. Informally, it represents the boundary between words.
        The sequence \B matches the empty string anywhere else.
        
        Example:
        import re

        Our goal is to extract the substring ""info@sololearn.com"".
        A basic email address consists of a word and may include dots or dashes. This is followed by the @ sign and the domain name (the name, a dot, and the domain name suffix).
        This is the basis for building our regular expression.
        
        pattern = r""([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)(\.[\w\.]+)""
        
        [\w\.-]+ matches one or more word character, dot or dash.
        The regex above says that the string should contain a word (with dots and dashes allowed), followed by the @ sign, then another similar word, then a dot and another word.
        
        Our regex contains three groups:
        1 - first part of the email address.
        2 - domain name without the suffix.
        3 - the domain suffix.

        Beautiful is better than ugly.
        Explicit is better than implicit.
        Simple is better than complex.
        Complex is better than complicated.
        Flat is better than nested.
        Sparse is better than dense.
        Readability counts.
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
        Although practicality beats purity.
        Errors should never pass silently.
        Unless explicitly silenced.
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        Now is better than never.
        Although never is often better than *right* now.
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
        
        
        Some lines in the Zen of Python may need more explanation.
        Explicit is better than implicit: It is best to spell out exactly what your code is doing. This is why adding a numeric string to an integer requires explicit conversion, rather than having it happen behind the scenes, as it does in other languages.
        Flat is better than nested: Heavily nested structures (lists of lists, of lists, and on and on…) should be avoided.
        Errors should never pass silently: In general, when an error occurs, you should output some sort of error message, rather than ignoring it.
        
        There are 20 principles in the Zen of Python, but only 19 lines of text.
        The 20th principle is a matter of opinion, but our interpretation is that the blank line means ""Use whitespace"".
        
        The line ""There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it"" references and contradicts the Perl language philosophy that there should be more than one way to do it.

        <tr><td>	PEP	</td><td>	"Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP) are suggestions for improvements to the language, made by experienced Python developers.
        PEP 8 is a style guide on the subject of writing readable code. It contains a number of guidelines in reference to variable names, which are summarized here:
        - modules should have short, all-lowercase names;
        - class names should be in the CapWords style;
        - most variables and function names should be lowercase_with_underscores;
        - constants (variables that never change value) should be CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES;
        - names that would clash with Python keywords (such as 'class' or 'if') should have a trailing underscore.
        
        PEP 8 also recommends using spaces around operators and after commas to increase readability.
        
        However, whitespace should not be overused. For instance, avoid having any space directly inside any type of brackets.
        
        Other PEP 8 suggestions include the following:
        - lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters;
        - 'from module import *' should be avoided;
        - there should only be one statement per line.
        
        It also suggests that you use spaces, rather than tabs, to indent. However, to some extent, this is a matter of personal preference. If you use spaces, only use 4 per line. It's more important to choose one and stick to it.
        
        The most important advice in the PEP is to ignore it when it makes sense to do so. Don't bother with following PEP suggestions when it would cause your code to be less readable; inconsistent with the surrounding code; or not backwards compatible.
        However, by and large, following PEP 8 will greatly enhance the quality of your code.

        In this call, 1  will be assigned to named_argument, and the remaining arguments 2,3,4,5 will be captured in the args tuple.
        
        Excercise:
        Given a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their sum.
        But we get an error when we want to sum more than 2 numbers. Change the function and complete the code so that the function sums as many numbers as are input.
        
        *args are accessible as the tuple args in the body of the function, so you can iterate through its items.
        
        def adder(x, *args):
            print(x + sum(args))
        
        adder(2, 3)
        adder(2, 3, 4)
        adder(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        
        The parameter *args must come after the named parameters to a function.
        The name args is just a convention; you can choose to use another.
        
        Named parameters to a function can be made optional by giving them a default value.
        These must come after named parameters without a default value.
        
        Example:
        def function(x, y, food=""spam""):
            print(food)
        
        function(1, 2)
        function(3, 4, ""egg"")
        
        OUTPUT
        spam
        egg
        
        In case the argument is passed in, the default value is ignored.
        If the argument is not passed in, the default value is used.
        
        
        **kwargs (standing for keyword arguments) allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance.
        The keyword arguments return a dictionary in which the keys are the argument names, and the values are the argument values.
        
        Example:
        def my_func(x, y=7, *args, **kwargs):
            print(kwargs)
        
        my_func(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, a=7, b=8)
        
        OUTPUT
        {'a': 7, 'b': 8}
        
        a and b are the names of the arguments that we passed to the function call.
        
        The arguments returned by **kwargs are not included in *args.

        Conditional expressions provide the functionality of if statements while using less code. They shouldn't be overused, as they can easily reduce readability, but they are often useful when assigning variables.
        Conditional expressions are also known as applications of the ternary operator.
        
        Example:
        status  = 1

        However, sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script.
        To do this, place script code inside if __name__ == ""__main__"".
        This ensures that it won't be run if the file is imported.
        
        Example:
        def function():
            print(""This is a module function"")

        This is a script
        
        When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it executes all of the code it finds in the file. Before executing the code, it defines a few special variables.
        For example, if the Python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value ""__main__"". If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module's name.
        
        If we save the code from our previous example as a file called sololearn.py, we can then import it to another script as a module, using the name sololearn.

        <tr><td>	Packages	</td><td>	"In Python, the term packaging refers to putting modules you have written in a standard format, so that other programmers can install and use them with ease.
        This involves use of the modules setuptools and distutils.
        The first step in packaging is to organize existing files correctly. Place all of the files you want to put in a library in the same parent directory. This directory should also contain a file called __init__.py, which can be blank but must be present in the directory.
        This directory goes into another directory containing the readme and license, as well as an important file called setup.py.
        
        Example directory structure:
        SoloLearn/
           LICENSE.txt
           README.txt
           setup.py
           sololearn/
              __init__.py
              sololearn.py
              sololearn2.py
        
        You can place as many script files in the directory as you need.
        
        The next step in packaging is to write the setup.py file.
        This contains information necessary to assemble the package so it can be uploaded to PyPI and installed with pip (name, version, etc.).
        Example of a setup.py file:
        
        from distutils.core import setup
        
        setup(
           name='SoloLearn', 
           version='0.1dev',
           packages=['sololearn',],
           license='MIT', 
           long_description=open('README.txt').read(),
        )
        
        After creating the setup.py file, upload it to PyPI, or use the command line to create a binary distribution (an executable installer).
        To build a source distribution, use the command line to navigate to the directory containing setup.py, and run the command 
        
        python setup.py sdist
        
        Run python setup.py bdist or, for Windows, python setup.py bdist_wininst to build a binary distribution.
        Use python setup.py register, followed by python setup.py sdist upload to upload a package.
