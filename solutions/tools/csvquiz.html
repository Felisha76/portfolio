How This Works:
File Naming Convention:
Files should be named with a prefix that indicates their category
For example: 
    en_hu_animals.csv, 
    math_fractions.csv, 
    game_pokemon.csv

Category Detection:
The getCategoryForFile function determines which category a file belongs to based on its prefix
Files that don't match any prefix go into an "Other" category

Dropdown Organization:
Files are grouped by category using the <optgroup> HTML element
Each category becomes a header in the dropdown
Files within each category are sorted alphabetically

Display Names:
The code removes the category prefix and file extension to create more readable display names
Underscores are replaced with spaces for better readability

Quiz Title:
When a quiz is selected, its name is displayed as a title above the cards
